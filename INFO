# Python-Data-Structures-Guide
Complete guide to Python data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and arrays with practical examples and explanations.........

This repository contains detailed explanations and implementations of fundamental Python data structures. Each data structure includes:

Clear explanations of concepts
Code examples with comments
Common operations and methods
Time complexity analysis
Practical use cases

📊 Data Structures Covered
1. Lists

Mutable, ordered sequences
Dynamic arrays that can store mixed data types
Common operations: append, insert, remove, slice

2. Tuples

Immutable, ordered sequences
Memory-efficient for fixed collections
Common operations: indexing, slicing, unpacking

3. Sets

Unordered collections of unique elements
Fast membership testing
Common operations: union, intersection, difference

4. Dictionaries

Key-value pairs (hash maps)
Fast lookups by key
Common operations: add, update, delete, retrieve

5. Arrays

Homogeneous data collections (using array module)
More memory-efficient than lists for numerical data
Type-constrained elements
